README or not idc.

This is my first project for github trial. I really don't know what I'm actually doing so I just keep going till I realize what I was doing all along.
I gotta update main.go and add some extra files, then that would be my first project for a long time. 
I guess I will finish this in 3-4 months and start looking for a job with normal salary to get an experience for the future.
